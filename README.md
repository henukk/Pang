# Pang

This project is a tribute to the classic arcade game Pang (also known as Super Pang outside Europe). It is a game developed for educational and entertainment purposes, paying tribute to one of the great classics of arcade games.

## Description

Inspired by the mechanics and spirit of the original game, this project seeks to recreate the fun and challenge that Pang offered. The player will have to overcome levels where the objective is to destroy all the bouncing bubbles, avoiding being touched by them.

## Features

- **Graphics and sounds inspired by the original game**: Although we do not use assets directly from the original game to avoid copyright infringement, the visual and audio style is inspired by classic Pang.
- **Challenging levels**: Each level increases in difficulty and presents new challenges to the player.
- **Familiar mechanics**: Lateral movement, upward shooting, and bubbles that split into smaller ones when hit.
